# Multiple Correspondence Analysis: Key Findings

## 1. Distinct Farmer Profiles

The MCA analysis identified distinct profiles of female farmers based on their categorical characteristics, forming meaningful clusters:

**Cluster 1**: Niveau socio-économique: moyen (76.9%), Tabagisme: non (76.9%), Neffa: non (100.0%)

**Cluster 2**: Domicile: sfax (80.0%), Niveau socio-économique: moyen (100.0%), Tabagisme: non (80.0%)

**Cluster 3**: Situation maritale: mariée (100.0%), Niveau socio-économique: moyen (100.0%), Tabagisme: non (100.0%)

## 2. Health Issues Pattern

Different clusters of farmers show distinctive patterns of health issues:

| Cluster | Main Health Issues |
|---------|-------------------|
| Cluster 1 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 2 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 3 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 4 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 5 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 6 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 7 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 8 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 9 | *No major health issues identified* |
| Cluster 10 | *No major health issues identified* |

## 3. Protection Equipment Impact

The analysis revealed important relationships between protection equipment usage and health outcomes:

*Protection-health relationship data not available*


## 4. Key Recommendations

Based on the MCA findings, the following interventions are recommended:

1. **Targeted Health Programs**: Develop health monitoring programs that address the specific health issues prevalent in each farmer cluster.

2. **Protection Equipment Education**: Implement education programs focused on the protection equipment that showed the strongest relationship with health outcomes.

3. **Risk Group Prioritization**: Prioritize interventions for the clusters showing the highest incidence of health issues or lowest usage of protective equipment.

4. **Working Conditions Improvement**: Address the work characteristics identified in the MCA as being associated with negative health outcomes.


## 5. Integration with PCA Results

The MCA findings complement the previous PCA results by adding categorical dimension analysis, providing a comprehensive picture of the factors affecting female farmers' health. The combined approaches reveal both numeric patterns (work hours, age, etc.) and categorical factors (protection usage, employment status, etc.) that contribute to health outcomes.
