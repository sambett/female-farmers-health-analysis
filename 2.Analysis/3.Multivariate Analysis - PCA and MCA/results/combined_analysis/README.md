# Combined PCA and MCA Analysis

This directory contains the results of integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) findings to reveal deeper patterns in the female farmers' health study.

## Purpose

The combined analysis aims to:

1. Map PCA clusters (based on numerical variables) to MCA clusters (based on categorical variables)
2. Identify relationships between numerical dimensions and categorical patterns
3. Visualize how protection behaviors vary across different numerical and categorical profiles
4. Generate integrated insights that neither method could reveal alone
5. Create comprehensive farmer profiles that account for both numerical and categorical characteristics

## Key Visualizations

- `pca_mca_cluster_relationship.png`: Heatmap showing how PCA clusters relate to MCA clusters
- `protection_in_pca_space.png`: Visualization of protection scores across PCA dimensions
- `protection_vs_cardiovascular.png`: Relationship between cardiovascular health (PC3) and protection behaviors
- `protection_vs_work_intensity.png`: Relationship between work intensity (PC4) and protection behaviors
- `regional_pca_distribution.png`: Distribution of regions across PCA dimensions
- `integrated_worker_profiles.png`: Visual summary of the combined farmer profiles

## Methodology

The combined analysis follows these steps:

1. **Cluster Mapping**: Associate each farmer with both their PCA cluster and MCA cluster
2. **Cross-tabulation Analysis**: Examine the distribution of farmers across both clustering schemes
3. **Integrated Visualization**: Create visualizations that incorporate both numerical and categorical dimensions
4. **Profile Integration**: Develop comprehensive profiles that blend insights from both analyses
5. **Relationship Analysis**: Investigate specific relationships between numerical factors and categorical patterns

## Key Findings

1. **Age-Experience-Protection Paradox**: Older, more experienced workers consistently show lower protection scores across both PCA and MCA analyses
2. **Family Structure Effects**: Family composition shows consistent effects across both analyses, with higher dependent numbers correlating with lower protection
3. **Regional Variation**: Geographic patterns identified in MCA have clear numerical correlates in PCA dimensions
4. **Protection Determinants Hierarchy**: Combined analysis reveals education has stronger effects than experience on protection behaviors
5. **Health-Safety Feedback Loop**: Workers with poorest cardiovascular health also show worst protection behaviors across both analyses

## How to Use These Results

These integrated findings should be used to develop more targeted interventions that account for the complex interplay between:

- Demographic factors (age, family structure, etc.)
- Socioeconomic conditions (education, resources, etc.)
- Work characteristics (hours, experience, tasks, etc.)
- Health status (cardiovascular indicators, etc.)
- Regional and cultural contexts (geographical location, traditions, etc.)

The combined profiles offer a more nuanced understanding of female farmers' health risks than either PCA or MCA could provide alone.
