## Analysis Methodology

The ANOVA analyses were conducted to identify statistically significant differences in protection behaviors and health outcomes across various demographic, work-related, and cultural groups. The methodology included:

1. One-way ANOVA tests for comparing means across multiple groups
2. Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) to identify specific group differences
3. Correlation analyses to measure relationships between numerical variables
4. Visualization of group differences through box plots and bar charts

## Key Files

- **ANOVA_Analysis_Report.pdf**: The comprehensive report detailing all ANOVA findings
- **Statistical_Significance_Summary.csv**: Summary of all statistically significant (p<0.05) findings
- **Visualizations**: Box plots and bar charts showing group differences for significant findings
